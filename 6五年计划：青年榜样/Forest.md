# Forest




## GO FETCH
```Python

# You've been caught in a burl trap!
# Send your pet to fetch the health potions!

def goFetch():
    # You can use loops in a handler function.
    while True:
        potion = hero.findNearestItem()
        if potion:
            # Use pet.fetch() to have your pet fetch a potion:
            pet.fetch(potion)
            pass

# When your pet is summoned, it triggers a "spawn" event.
# This tells your pet to run goFetch() at the start of the level
pet.on("spawn", goFetch)


```
此处应该注意文中写的是potion。
